As an avid traveler
I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection so that my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.

Given a budget tracker without an internet connection the user inputs an expense or deposit, they will then receive a notification they have added a transaction once the user restablishes an internet connection.
